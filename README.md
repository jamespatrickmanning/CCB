This repository has a separate branch for each Figure in the Liu et al paper on simulating turtle strandings on Cape Cod.
This particular branch has all the code and files related to supplementary material 1 ("S1").

Note: The particle_tracking routine requires input files that were too big to fit on the github drive. Contact J Manning for input.
