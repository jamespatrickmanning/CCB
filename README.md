# backtracking results
This repository has a separate branch for each Figure in the Liu et al paper on simulating turtle strandings on Cape Cod.
This branch has code for Figures 11, 12 and 13 where the latter two are related to backtracking particles. The full set is in the zip file. The "pltx.py" routine generates all three figures assuming other routines to conduct the particle tracking have already been run. The "other routines" are, for example, Back_forecast_function_2012.py and track2012.py.

In July 2019, Felicia cleaned up the code that creates both the temperature hincast time sereis (Fig 12 in Feb 2019 version) and the backtracking with Nov and Dec strandings map (Fig 13 in Feb 2019 version). She called this code "Fig12-13_backtracking.py" and made it work in Python 3.7. Use the zip file to get the latest version including JiM's modifications in Sep 2019.
